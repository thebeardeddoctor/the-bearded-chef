# The Bearded Chef Recipe Web Book
## Description
---
This project will consist of a static webpage highlighting my favorite homecooked recipes. Later iterations will include more dynamic features to bring the webpage to life, thereby  enriching the user experience.

Each recipe will include:
- Photography
- Serving sizes
- Intructions and preparation
- Nutrition facts

~~~
Later developments may include video demonstrations!
